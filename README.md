# Mechatronics Workshop

Connect USB-A cable to PC and connect on the other side the USB-micro B to the ESP32 board to power the board. Load code onto the board to run.
Each lab focuses on one part of the clothing line. The "final" is a cumulation of everything learned from the labs to make the clothesline.
